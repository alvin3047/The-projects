## Large number multiplicaiton VEDIC MATHS 
The projects deals with the large number multipication in c++ programming using vedic maths techniques. [IXI method vedic maths](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Vedic_Mathematics/Techniques/Multiplication)
- The IXI method is used and with every iteration we get the unknown rightmost digit.
- Maximum of `N` iterations are done to calculate the value. `N` corresponds to the maximum length of input.
